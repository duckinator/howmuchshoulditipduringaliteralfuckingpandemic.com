<h1>How much should I tip workers during a literal fucking pandemic?</h1>
<main>
    <h2>$25 or 40%, whichever is more.</h2>

    <p>During a pandemic, ordering delivery or take-out is <em>asking people to risk their lives</em>.</p>
    <p>To make it worse, these people are usually paid very little.</p>
    <p>For that reason: <strong>always tip, tip well, and be kind</strong>.</p>

    <p>P.S.: This website is aimed at people who can afford to tip well but choose not to, and nobody else. &hearts;</p>
